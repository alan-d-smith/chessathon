# Working in this repo

This is a starter for AI Chessathon, a chess-engine competition. The deliverable is one file,
`agent.py`, exposing `get_move(fen, time_left_ms) -> str`. It gets zipped and uploaded, and the
platform plays it against other people's agents on a fixed cadence.

## Read the rules from the source

The competition rules and the agent contract live on the site and change. Fetch them before you
answer anything about limits, deadlines, or what is allowed:

- https://aichessathon.com/docs/agent-contract.md
- https://aichessathon.com/docs/rules.md

There is no copy of either in this repo on purpose. Fetch the URLs.

## The contract, in one place

- `agent.py` at the root of the zip, not inside a folder. The platform does `import agent`.
- `get_move(fen: str, time_left_ms: int) -> str` returning UCI, `e2e4` or `e7e8q`.
- Your colour is the side to move in the fen. There is no other input.
- The process starts once per game and stays alive between your moves. Module state survives to
  your next move in the same game, never to the next game.
- Import time has a 60 second budget before the clock starts. Load weights there.
- 120 s + 0.5 s per move, per side, on wall time. One core, 2 GB, no network, no GPU.
- Illegal move, malformed output, crash, out of memory, or flag fall loses that game.

## Things that break agents here

- The filesystem is read-only apart from 256 MB at `/tmp`. `HOME` and every cache path already
  point there; do not write anywhere else.
- No network at all. Nothing downloads at runtime. Weights ship inside the zip.
- One core. `torch.set_num_threads(1)`. More threads lose time rather than winning it.
- Your zip is first on `sys.path`. Never name a file after a module you import: `chess.py`,
  `types.py`, `random.py` will shadow the real one and the failure will look unrelated.
- `requirements.txt` takes plain package names and version specifiers only. No URLs, no index
  options, no local wheels, and only packages with a Linux wheel on PyPI.
- Native binaries in the zip are rejected. Ship source; take compiled code from public packages.
- `print` is safe. The runner points file descriptor 1 at stderr before importing the agent, so
  nothing you write can corrupt the protocol. It is discarded in rated games and shown in the
  validation log.

## Do not

- Do not use Stockfish, Lc0, Maia, or any existing engine, in any form, including a pip package
  that embeds one. It is an instant disqualification and it is checked after the fact.
- Do not add network calls, subprocess calls to external binaries, or anything that reads outside
  the agent directory and `/tmp`.
- Do not obfuscate. What ships has to be source a judge can read.
- Do not edit `harness/`. It mirrors the platform's protocol and clock. Changing it makes local
  results meaningless.

## Verify

```
make play      # one game against a baseline, real time control
make arena     # 20 fast games against a baseline, with a score
make zip       # build submission.zip with agent.py at the root
make gate      # ruff, mypy, and two games that have to finish cleanly
```

Nothing here decides whether an upload is accepted. The platform validates on upload and writes a
log to the dashboard; that log is the authority. The harness exists so local games are honest.

## Style

Python 3.12, type-annotated, ruff and mypy strict clean. Keep `agent.py` readable: it is the
thing a judge reads if your games get flagged, and the thing you have to explain at the final.
